# NHibernate.AspNet.Identity.Example
A short and sweet example of how to do NHibernate backed identity-provision with ASP.NET MVC 5. 

You can read more about this code [here](http://www.lshift.net/blog/2016/07/07/simple-user-authentication-asp-net-identity-and-nhibernate/). 
Please note that this code (as the licence says) comes with no warranty, a fact of particular relevance 
given that, in any real application, this would be security critical code. 
Please think carefully through your own security requirements.

## Getting it running
1. Update the connection string in Web.config to point at a database you have write access to.
2. Run the setup-database.sql script to create the database and the user table.
